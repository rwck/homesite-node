          <h3>A bit about me</h3>
          <p>
            I've been into computing since my Dad brought home a Sinclair ZX81.
          </p>
          <p>
            In my teens I broke and fixed lots of Windows computers. I built my first desktop computer when I was in my early twenties.
          </p>

          <p>
            But I've always worked in other fields.
          </p>

          <p>
            Now I've decided to make my living from doing what has always been my passion.
          </p>

            <p>
            Graduated as Master of Studies with Distinction
            </p>

            <p>
            Studied the first year of a PhD; decided to engage with the real world for a bit instead, have not looked back.
            </p>

            <p>
            Qualified as a Journalist, Highbury College Portsmouth
            </p>

            <p>
            Worked briefly in newspaper journalism before being hired as a professional copywriter for a technical Marketing company called Writing Machine. Stayed there too long for everyone, had worked my way up to Head of Writing at the agency by the time I left.
            </p>

            <p>
            Talked my way into a job with a startup recruitment company called Practicus.
            </p>

            <p>
            Did quite well there, was the first consultant ever to write Â£100,000 in a single month.
            </p>

            <p>
            Became the go-to guy for difficult things: setting up a new desk to cover the retail or pharmaceutical industry.
            </p>

            <p>
            Was asked to help set up the Australian division of the business. Did so. Moved on.
            </p>

            <p>
            Worked very briefly for another recruitment company that I didn't enjoy very much.
            </p>

            <p>
            Set up my own recruitment consultancy. Just me and some pretty major accounts. Enjoyed being my own boss, having control and seeing and owning every step of the value chain.
            </p>

            <p>
            Fell out of love with recruitment, decided to study full time web development course at General Assembly Sydney. Learned a whole load of new stuff and really got the bug for learning more in tech.
            </p>

            <p>
            And there you have it.
